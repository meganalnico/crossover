# **_Crossover_** - Superhumans and the PFSDR

*Compiled from OGL and Creatve Commons content by Megan Alnico*

## Starting Characters

In general, the superhero genre features experienced characters whose capabilities don’t grow a significant amount over the course of their careers. In contrast, the PFSRD based games feature characters who start out with little experience but who can rise in power to shake the girders of the world.

A **_Crossover_** series assumes the typical PFSRD approach, but it is nonetheless a game about near-godlike superhuman powers. It’s tough to embody such fearsome potency with a mere 1st-level character, so characters in a standard crossover campaign start at 3rd level. The character’s 1st level must be a class level, to which the superhuman template is applied. The character then selects two additional character levels — either two class levels, two Superhuman levels, two Aberrant levels (see Chapter Three: Quantum, “Aberrant Level”), or any combination thereof.

> **Example**:  *Seth’s character idea is Deadbolt, a small-time thief who erupts as a superhuman. He selects scoundrel at 1st level, then applies the superhuman template. Seth now has two more character levels to take. He selects one additional level of scoundrel and decides on one level of aberrant (Deadbolt has a tough time controlling his quantum energies), creating a male human (superhuman) Sco2/Abr1 starting character.*

This still won’t make the PCs as powerful as Superman or Magneto out of the gate — they must earn that kind of power and experience — but it does start them at a level superior to those everyday folks known as nonplayer characters (NPCs).

## Characteristics
The concept of the superhuman is quite popular in science fiction, where superhumans are often cyborgs, mutants, aliens, telepaths, the product of ongoing human evolution or genetically engineered.

One type of superhuman described in science fiction stories, particularly during the Atomic Age, derives from the concept of mutation or further human evolution. In such tales, a human would evolve into or give birth to a being that has powers not yet exhibited by 'baseline' humans. In some stories, these humans are either unable to get along with "normal" humanity, or will ultimately supersede them entirely, causing the eventual extinction of the descendants of contemporary baseline humanity.

The rules presented in *crossover* are specifically tailored to this type of hero. One whom is the product of human evolution, genetically engineered, or accidental mutation.

### Human
**Description:**  The average everyday person. By far the vast majority of the world’s sentient population in the Trinity Universe is human. Some scientists theorize that any human has the genetic potential to manifest a Mazarin–Rashoud node and erupt; others believe that only those with a particular genetic makeup can become superhumans. Regardless, the typical human has no superhuman abilities.

**Appearance:** Humans come in all shapes, sizes, colors, noises and smells. They are found in every corner of the world.

#### Human Racial Traits

**Medium:** As Medium creatures, humans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Speed:** Human base land speed is 30 feet.

**Skilled:** Humans gain an additional skill rank at first level and one additional rank whenever they gain a level.

**Educated:** Humans in the modern world have access to information and schooling unmatched at any time in human history. Humans gain full proficiency in their native languages and are considered literate unless their backgrounds dictate otherwise. All humans my add one craft or profession in addition to one skill that is always considered "in-class". Starting characters receive one additional "in-class" skill  or language per point of Intelligence bonus.

#### Superhuman Template (Archetype)
**Description:** Individuals with this template gain fantastic physiological benefits upon the emergence. A superhuman may be stronger, faster or smarter than a normal human; he might be able to fly, fire bolts of energy from his hands or shape the weather by force of will. Such stupendous capabilities are channeled via a new ability: ***Quantum***. As a superhuman gains experience with his newfound powers and his M–R node continues to develop, he may develop powers to rival the gods of ancient myth.

**Appearance:** Superhumans appear to be human, though in most cases they are impressive physical specimens. Whether large and strong or nimble and quick, Superhumans tend to catch the eye - they aren’t easily forgotten about or ignored.

**Ability Score Racial Traits**: Superhuman characters gain a +2 racial bonus to one ability score of their choice at creation to represent their varied nature.
